Every year, the newspaper I work for takes ballets from readers in order for them to vote for their favorite businesses. This year, I was tasked with designing many of the graphics. The hardest part of making this is making a logo that is flexible and can be adapted to work with other logos in various ads because businesses will want to announce them being a winner. I think the logo ended up looking great, but it's the opposite of flexible. It's nice and trendy, but that doesn't work with a lot of businesses who specialize in flooring, selling RVs, selling cars, and various things.

I designed 2 cover pages. I wanted them to be very basic and just alternates of each other. They both include an older map of Texarkana, where this newspaper is based.

I also had to lay out 2 full pages for announcing the winners.

To give you a good example of how my fellow designers would use the ribbons I designed specifically for the Reader's Choice ads, here is Fish Bowl's ad:

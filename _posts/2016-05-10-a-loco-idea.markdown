Back in 2015 I created a brand called Game Loco to go along with a [really snazzy URL][gamelo.co]. After I made a unique and snazzy logo for it, I hit a brick wall. "What in the world will the content be?" I asked myself. And up until last night, I didn't have a clue.

From this point forward I will be working on a premium service for Twitch and YouTube Gaming streamers. Within it, they get custom designed graphics for their stream page and social networking pages. They also get high quality overlay graphics custom tailored to them. Last but certainly not least, they will get an exclusive donation system that is also custom made for them. Because of this, I gain 100% control over the customization options. This means fancy donation pages like in this mock up:

There could also be options of voting on polls when you donate $1.00 or more; or also being able to pick a sound that plays with the donation alert pops up. Speaking of donation alerts, this system allows full customization to the alerts as well. With the current systems out there like Twitch Alerts, you're only able to do so much. But now, I can do things like the following mock up:

I will begin working on this system, mostly from scratch utilizing the [Twitch REST API][twitch-api] and the [Paypal REST API][paypal-api] as well as utilizing CSS, MySQL, HTML, PHP, and jQuery to animate the alerts. Is this an easy task for me? Not nessarily but I can take baby steps to get to a full featured dashboard for my clients.

**If you are interested in these features, please be patient and look for an announcement in this coming months.**

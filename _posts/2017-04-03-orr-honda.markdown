While working at Wehco & Palmer, I was tasked with designing several advertisement campaigns for Orr Honda of Texarkana. Some are stickers, some are full newspaper spreads. Pretty work intensive so I'm very proud of them.

The sticker ads were placed on newspapers and other publications. These weren't as hard to build.

I really enjoyed making this energetic sticker ad.

This ended up being very popular even though I'm not super fond of it. But it is still a nice clean ad.

I had roughly 5 hours to make a Christmas ad. Lots of beautiful vectors were made. I love this ad.

This took a lot of trial and error to get how I wanted it. The end result was so nice that they made me run it multiple times with different sizes and variations.

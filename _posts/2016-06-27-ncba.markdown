The large video gaming community around Rocket League needed a central hub for various eSports information. So I created the National Car Ball Association as a joke.

Along with that came a [stylish website for eSports](http://nationalcarball.com/test/features/). Understand that right now some of the features aren't working (like a list of upcoming events).

And last but not least came a news show about the game. I decided to make the logo look like a sports show.

Because of the look of the logo, we went the direction of a legitimate sports news show. It did pretty well for our first show like it. Here is one of the first episodes:

We even have two professional teams under the NCBA name. Here is a small clip of them working their magic:
